Most of this is at least somewhat self-explanatory, but Ruijuan can answer any questions.
The multispec outputs are the means for each of the 5 bands per plot on 6 dates. These ARE
filtered to include only plant pixels, not ground. The last 2 dates are not included because
the plants are turning brown by then and more difficult to segment.

This data should be used for color/spectral reflectance. If you want the height data derived 
from RGB imagery, please see the file and extensive README in the CanopyHeightArchitecture 
group's folder. If you want digested summaries of that data, you will have to create them
yourselves, and perhaps collaborate with that group once they convert to canopy height
(see their README).

Recall the tar spot field is a different location and therefore different plot numbers. I
will include a key that tells you what varieties are where so you can link them up, but
PLEASE refrain from doing any genotype-phenotype analysis in this module.
